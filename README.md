# plexus-javac-compiler-bug

I originally reported this issue as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MCOMPILER-325, but the Maven folks told me it was a Plexus issue. Then some time passed while I didn't have time to work on it, but I've now put together a simple project to reproduce the issue directly using Plexus. This is it. I'll be referencing this project from a bug I'm about to report to the Plexus folks.
